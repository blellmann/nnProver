# nnProver

nnProver is a prototype implementation of proof search and countermodel construction for basic non-normal modal logics in the nested sequent framework.

The prover is based on the article [Combining monotone and normal modal logic in nested sequents -- with countermodels](https://mimamsa.logic.at/files/2019TABLEAUXNS4BiM.pdf) (published in TABLEAUX 2019).

You can also run the prover using a [web interface](http://subsell.logic.at/bprover/nnProver/).
